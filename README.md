## Resume

### About me
 Primarily I am a PHP-developer with huge interest of learning more, and that had lead me to my position right now; CTO at **Comparico**.
    My days consists of managing the workload and workflow of the other developer. This means planning the architecural-, structural- and agile setting and making sure that the rest of the team and company have the tools necessary to make wonders happen. The goal is to decrease "grindy" and time consuming tasks in the work environment and increasing the time doing the parts that are fun and important to them and Comparico.
    
I also continue to code, heading our data gathering service for the Telecom-side of our business.
    
    
Previously to this I worked as an IT/Archive-consultant for **ArkivIT**, taking the lead in our projects to streamlining our process of implementing the archive software to our clients.
    
    
Before **ArkivIT** I studied to become a teacher in IT and Geography but aborted it because I decided it wasn't for me, longing back to the tech industry.
    
Iâ€™ve also been developing a PHP and AngularJS application for internal use for the swedish train company SJ.
    
Before **SJ**, I was a IT-manager/Developer at **Improveme.se** with a magazine with over 4000 blogs connected to its blog network.
    
Improveme Online Network had (when I worked there) week 44 in 2012 780 000 unique visitors, top 20 largest sites in Sweden.
    
I have also worked in first line support for Stockholm Hospitals and 6 years in a grocery store, so I have acquired some social/customer skills along the way.
