## Daniel Westerlings CV

### About me
Primarily I am a PHP-developer with huge interest of learning more. I just aborted my studies to become a teacher in IT and Geography because I decided it wasnt for me. Before my current job as an Lead Developer of digital archives for [ArkivIT](http://arkivit.se) using open source applications like [Archivematica](https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica) and inhouse built delivery systems for metadata and data, I've been developing a PHP and AngularJS application for internal use for the swedish train company SJ. The application uses MySQL as the database system. Before SJ, I was a IT-manager/Developer at improveme.se with a Wordpress MultiSite with over 4000 blogs connected to its blog network. Improveme Online Network had (when I worked here) week 44 in 2012 780 000 unique visitors, top 20 largest sites in Sweden. I have also worked in first line support for Stockholm Hospitals and 6 years in a grocery store, so I have acquired some social/customer skills along the way.


I live in Uppsala, Sweden. I play badminton twice a week and enjoy hanging out with friends. I'm 28 years old, born in October, 1990.
I have a daughter born in January 2019 and live with my fiancee Maria.
