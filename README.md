## Daniel Westerlings CV

### About me
Primarily I'm a PHP-developer with huge interest of learning more. At the moment im studying to become a teacher in IT and Geography but has decided it wasnt for me. I have been developing a PHP and AngularJS application for internal use for the swedish train company SJ at the moment. The application uses MySQL as the database system. Before that job, I was a IT-manager/Developer at improveme.se with a Wordpress MultiSite with over 4000 blogs connected to its blog network. Improveme Online Network had week 44 in 2012 780 000 unique visitors. I have also worked in first line support for Stockholm Hospitals and 6 years in a grocery store, so I have acquired some social/customer skills along the way.


I live in Sysslomansgatan, Uppsala, Sweden. I play badminton twice a week and enjoy hanging out with friends. Im 27 years old, born in October, 1990.
