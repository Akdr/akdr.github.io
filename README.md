## Resume

### About me
Primarily I am a PHP-developer with huge interest of learning more, and that had lead me to my position right now; in the startup phase of my own freelancing firm.

Just recently I was Senior Developer and Consultant at **Entire**. The company went bankrupt in 2023, so I am currently looking for new opportunities.

Previously to this I worked as an CTO for **Comparico**.
> My days consisted of managing the workload and workflow of the other developer. This means planning the architectural-, structural- and agile setting and making sure that the rest of the team and company have the tools necessary to make wonders happen. 

The goal is to decrease "grindy" and time-consuming tasks in the work environment and increasing the time doing the parts that are fun and important to them and Comparico.

I also continue to code, heading our data gathering service for the Telecom-side of our business.

> Previously to this I worked as an IT/Archive-consultant for ArkivIT, taking the lead in our projects to streamlining our process of implementing the archive software to our clients.

Before **ArkivIT** I studied to become a teacher in IT and Geography but aborted it because I decided it wasn't for me, longing back to the tech industry.
    
Iâ€™ve also been developing a PHP application for internal use for the swedish train company SJ.
    
Before **SJ**, I was a IT-manager/Developer at **Improveme.se** with a magazine with over 4000 blogs connected to its blog network.
    
Improveme Online Network had (when I worked there) week 44 in 2012 780 000 unique visitors, top 20 largest sites in Sweden.
    
I have also worked in a grocery store for 6 years, so I have acquired some social/customer skills along the way.
